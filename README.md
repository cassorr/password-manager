# password-manager
This is a password manager where I used encryption for the time. 

The manager works by creating a master passaword, converted into bytes for encryption,
and then is used as the key to have access to all passwords located in the manager. 

Passwords can either be added, which also uses byte conversion for encryption, or can be viewed
in the terminal. Lastly, users can clsoe the manager by quiting. 

I added comments throughout explainging what each line of code does in respect to the 
encryption module used. Very happy with the result and hope you enjoy! :)
